Astronomers have discovered a new exoplanet that might have liquid water 
            on its surface. This planet orbits a red dwarf star located 40 light-years 
            away from Earth. Using the James Webb Telescope, scientists are now 
            analyzing the atmosphere for signs of oxygen and methane.
